1. Peak Global Interest in 'Workout'
   
The global search for 'workout' reached its peak in the year 2020. This surge in interest can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many individuals turned to online and at-home fitness solutions due to lockdowns and gym closures.

2. Keyword Popularity During and Post-COVID
